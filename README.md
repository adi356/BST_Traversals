## To Run Project
1. Use 'make' command to create executables
2. Execute by using './P0 [fileName]' or run './P0' with no file input to enter keyboard input mode.
3. If in keyboard input mode need to use ctrl+d as the EOF token (note: for some reason it sometimes requires you to do ^D twice)
4. To clean project use 'make clean' command
